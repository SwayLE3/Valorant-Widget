# Valorant-Widget
This is the repository of the Github version of my android app
For this to work you need an API key that you can find here ; [Henrik's discord](https://discord.gg/QSrP7yYcJ9)

Thanks a lot to [Henrik](https://github.com/Henrik-3) for his incredible work which without it would be impossible.
